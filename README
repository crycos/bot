# This program focuses on building a conversational bot used for online support. It is based on Ruby Novice to Professional by Apress.
# First step is to create a Text Processing Tools Library, folllwing these basic flowchart: 

# START -> Accept User Input -> Clean up and expand text -> Split input into sentences and words -> Find vi
# able response from phrase sets -> Switch object senses for response -> Substitute user phrases into responses phrases -> Return result to user -> END
#
# Step 1. Building the WordPlay Library
# Step 2. Bulding a unit testing class
# Step 3. Building a bot

The Program’s Life Cycle and Parts
In Figure 12-2, we looked at what happens when a bot is asked to respond to some user
input. In Figure 12-3, however, we look at the more overall life cycle of a bot, and the client
accessing it, that we’ll develop.
Your entire application will be composed of four parts:
	 1.	 The Bot class, within bot.rb, containing all the bot’s logic and any subclasses.
	 2.	 The WordPlay library, within wordplay.rb, containing the WordPlay class and  extensions to String.
	 3.	 Basic “client” applications that create bots and allows users to interact with them.
	 4.	 A helper program to generate the bot’s data files easily.
