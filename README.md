The Program’s Life Cycle and Parts

The entire application will be composed of four parts:
	 1.	 The Bot class, within bot.rb, containing all the bot’s logic and any subclasses.
	 2.	 The WordPlay library, within wordplay.rb, containing the WordPlay class and  extensions to String.
	 3.	 Basic “client” applications that create bots and allows users to interact with them.
	 4.	 A helper program to generate the bot’s data files easily.
